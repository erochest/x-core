This is a library for an opinionated, idiosyncratic personal organization
system. Mine.

This package contains the core type system for the various parts. It's meant to
be small and tightly focused. It doesn't have anything about UI or persistence
or any other side effect. Those will be provided other packages that depend on
this one. This package will just make sure the others are consistent and using
the same data types.

# ToDos

Todos is patterned on [todotxt][todotxt], but I've been wanting a slightly
richer data model, a firmer specification, and availability in new platforms.
I always wanted to be able to link my todo items to notes, time tracking, and
other parts of my system without having to repeat myself.
